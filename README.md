# midterm-project-Erhardt4
This project attempts to answer the question: Are individuals in the USA with access to Google culturally aware (or care) of international democracy changes? In order to answer this question, data from google trends was used to judge cultural awareness and EIU Democracy Indexes data from Gapminder was used to judge changes in democracy in countries around the world. Data from both data sets were plotted as line graphs to compare democracy index over time to frequency of keywords over time. The rate of change of democracy indexes and keyword frequency was looked at to compare the magnitudes of correlating rates of change. Each data set was individually plotted as histograms and a box plot in order to understand more context about the data.

No packages are libraries are needed to run this code.

No changes to the code are needed to run this code.

Similar data to the data used for the EIU Democracy Indexes data can be found at https://www.gapminder.org/data/ under "select an indicator" > "society" > "democracy" > "democracy indexs from EIU". Data similar to the data used for the google trends can be found at https://trends.google.com/ for any keyword or search time. This data can be viewed at this site or accessed through the pytrends api.

In order to generate plots similar to the plots plotting democracy index data, the following functions which are found in gapMinderDataManipulation.py can be used: plot_data, plot_chosen_countries, plot_rates, plot_rate_chosen_countries, plot_histogram, plot_histogram_all_years, plot_histogram_all_data. The functions plot_data and plot_chosen_countries generates line graphs of the EIU Index data with the proper title, axis labels, and legend. The functions plot_rates and plot_rate_chosen_countries generate line graphs of the rate of change of EIU Index data with the proper title, axis labels, and legend. The functions plot_histogram, plot_histogram_all_years, and plot_histogram_all_data plot histograms of the EIU Democracy Index data with the proper title and axis labels.
