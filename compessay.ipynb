    "Our question we are trying to answer is: *Are individuals in the USA with access to Google culturally aware (or care) of international democracy changes?*\n",
    "\n",
    "> This question is interesting to explore because we want to see if individuals are searching for international democracy changes. If there were extreme changes in a country, it would be a good sign for people to be searching for such changs, as this would mean individuals are being better global citizens. \n",
    "We took data from Google Trends, where Google stores search popularity over time on its search engine. You are free to search some terms on Google's UI of Google Trends. (add link) We used this tool as to grasp an initial understanding of what are data was and what it means, as well as looking at areas to explore or specify in. For example, we decided to restrict our searches to US as it would be bias to not include non-english terms in our searches. Our EIU data is from Gapminder, which can be found here (talk more about it, and/or as we can say anything).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Trends Data\n",
    "> The Google Trends data was accessed using an api called *Pytrends*. We used Pytrends to collect historical interest of specified keywords from 2006-2018 per month. The data is normalized on a scale from 0-100, where 100 would be highest interest, and 0 would least interest. In this case, all historical interest is in the scope of just the United States. This data was saved with `makeCSV()` and read with the `readCSV()` function. The data was saved in a CSV to avoid pinging google several times and saves the data in a folder called *pytrends_Data* and named as keywords. The data was processed using Pandas and its dataframe methods. This data was plotted to show graphs of rolling averages, rate of changes, histograms, boxplots, and interest over time. \n",
